<h3 id="blueprint">Welcome aboard the Generation Ship Cyclica.</h3>
<p>My name is Cyclica, and I will be both the vessel of the first <i>Promise Project</i> and the on-board Advanced Personified Spaceflight Assistant. Allow me to give you a quick tour of my environments.</p> 
<img src="Cyclica Blueprint.png" alt="The blueprint of the spaceship Cyclica, with size comparisons, room labels and various measurements" width="996" height="763" style="float:center; text-align:center; display:block; margin:0 auto;" usemap="#vanhamaa">
<p>I am a small spacecraft designed for multi-decade interplanetary travel. I consist of a central backbone of roughly 150m in length named Core Spine, at the ends of which are installed the main control cockpit and the fusion reactor. You humans won’t need to worry about either: as a piloting assistant, navigation operations will entirely be under my responsibility.</p>
<p>Attached to the Core Spine are three Lifts, each named after one of the seas around the European continent (humans love their homeland, or so I am told), which lead to the Inner and Outer Rings. The Rings are two concentric cylinders of 46m and 50m radius respectively, rotating around the Core Spine with an angular velocity of about 0.419 rad/s. This speed is kept constant in order to have an acceleration that corresponds to roughly 0.89g in the Outer Ring and 0.82g in the Inner Ring. This lowered gravity should be enough for humans to maintain their bodily functions minimally impacted.</p>
<p>Both Rings are hermetically sealed to preserve the simulated atmosphere inside them and allow the crew to live inside without wearing a spacesuit. Around 17'500m<sup>2</sup> of water are contained in two reservoirs, a swimming pool and a pond. Humans also love water, beyond their biological needs.</p>
<p>More small thrusters are installed around the Outer Ring, mainly used for steering and decelerating in case of emergency. Due to the nature of the Promise Project, its fuel tanks are very limited in capacity, allowing only for minor changes of course or velocity. The complete route has already been planned along the Second Grand Planetary Tour, and there will be minimal need for course changes.</p>

<h3 id="promise">“The longest project ever undertaken by humanity.”</h3>
<p><i>The Promise Project</i> is the first large-scale space program conducted by Frontier Corporation. Taking advantage of a particularly favourable configuration of planets at the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, the Second Grand Planetary Tour, it features the outward and return of the spaceark Cyclica and its crew.</p>
<h5>Testing Interplanetary Travel</h5>
<p>Cyclica’s first mission is a tentative run of a generational ship, in order to test the frontierz of technological development and space travel before venturing into other star systems. Most of the equipment inside the ship has been built with the purpose of sustaining human life for several decades, from basic needs to entertainment and mental wellbeing.</p>
<h5>Testing multiple anchor brain supports</h5>
<p>The <i>Simulacrum Protocol</i> technology for conscience transfer has so far only been tested on isolated individuals and for limited amounts of time. In order to avoid generational issues, such as forcing the crewmates’ offspring to live in an environment they didn’t choose for themselves and would have no way of opting out of, the mission involves multiple anchor brain supports operating at the same time. The <i>Hatcher</i> is the room designed to host them.</p>
<h5>Testing extraliving conditions on human subjects</h5>
<p>Due to the <i>Simulacrum Protocol</i>, human consciousness is allowed to exceed the life of a single body. The consequences of this practice are largely untested, and the <i>Promise Project</i> aims to study the effects and changes of a single conscience spanning across multiple bodies. Funding for this area of research has been provided extensively by the Everlonger Foundation.</p>
